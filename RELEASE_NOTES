RELEASE NOTES
-------------

v0.9::

  * Dependency SOAP4R 1.5.7+ has better support for arrays.  Notice how the 
    test/tc_routing.rb test had to be changed:

      -    assert_equal(resp.categoryArray.category.categoryName, "eBay Motors")
      +    assert_equal(resp.categoryArray[0].categoryName, "eBay Motors")

    When single element arrays are returned in the SOAP response, you now 
    access them with the familiar Ruby array index, instead of following the
    XML tree and putting "." in between each node.
