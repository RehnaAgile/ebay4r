== Welcome to eBay4R

eBay4R is a Ruby wrapper for eBay's Web Services SOAP API (v433). Emphasis is
on ease of use and small footprint.

<b>This code is currently alpha stage</b>.

Please report bugs and other problems, see "Author" section at the bottom.

Current releases and CVS snapshots can be downloaded from:

http://rubyforge.org/projects/ebay4r


== Requirements

* SOAP4R library newer than v1.5.5.  At the time of this writing, the latest
  version was v1.5.5, which will not work.  You have to get a snapshot that is
  dated 11-06-2005 or newer.  You can find development snapshots here:

  http://dev.ctor.org/download

  So, for example, to download the 11-06-2005 snapshot (the one I personally
  used during development), go here:

  http://dev.ctor.org/download/archive/soap4r-20051106.tar.gz

  Note: I _have_ seen one instance of SOAP4R v1.5.5 work out-of-the-box, and
  that was on a Ruby v1.8.3 source install on NetBSD 2.1.  On my Debian 3.1
  box, however, I had to install the newer snapshot.  Go figure, I don't 
  know what the diff is...


== Optionals

* RubyGems


== Installation

=== tar/gzip

Just unzip the archive anywhere you like, and see "Getting Started" below 
(you will need to add the ebay4r/lib path to your $RUBYLIB environment
variable)

=== RubyGems

* To install a gem you already downloaded:
  
    gem install ebay-<version>.gem

* For the latest release with no fuss (previous download not required):
  
    gem install -r ebay4r

=== CVS

You can download the latest and greatest code using anonymous CVS, just type:

  cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@rubyforge.org:/var/cvs/ebay4r login
  cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@rubyforge.org:/var/cvs/ebay4r checkout ebay4r


== Getting Started

If you installed eBay4R from a tarball or CVS, you will want to add the
ebay4r/lib directory to your Ruby include path ($RUBYLIB).  Then put

  require 'eBayAPI'

at the top of your programs.

If you installed eBay4R with RubyGems, you don't have to add anything to
Ruby's include path, just put

  require 'rubygems'
  require_gem 'ebay'

at the top of your programs.

=== Examples

Look at the examples/ directory.  Edit the file myCredentials.rb and insert
the appropriate values.  Then you can run any of the example programs.

==== Hello, World!

The simplest eBay API call is "GeteBayOfficialTime".  Here's how to call it
with eBay4R:

  require 'rubygems'
  require_gem 'ebay'

  # Put your credentials in this file
  load('myCredentials.rb')

  # Create new eBay caller object.  Omit last argument to use live platform.
  eBay = EBay::API.new($authToken, $devId, $appId, $certId, :sandbox => true)

  resp = eBay.GeteBayOfficialTime

  puts "Hello, World!"
  puts "The eBay time is now: #{resp.timestamp}"

  # Wasn't that easy?!

==== Adding an Item

This is a more complex example that performs a real (useful) function:

  require 'rubygems'
  require_gem 'ebay'

  load('myCredentials.rb')

  eBay = EBay::API.new($authToken, $devId, $appId, $certId, :sandbox => true)

  # New method of generating complex types, needs some more testing...
  resp = eBay.AddItem(:Item => EBay.Item(:PrimaryCategory => EBay.Category(:CategoryID => 57882),
                                         :Title => 'Mouse Pad',
                                         :Description => 'A really cool mouse pad, you know you want it...',
                                         :Location => 'On Earth',
                                         :StartPrice => 12.0,
                                         :Quantity => 1,
                                         :ListingDuration => "Days_7",
                                         :Country => "US",
                                         :Currency => "USD",
                                         :PaymentMethods => ["VisaMC", "PersonalCheck"]))

  puts "New Item #" + resp.itemID + " added."


=== Format of Requests

If <tt>eBay</tt> is your caller object, then you can issue any eBay API call
by doing:

  eBay.<call_name>( ... hash of named-arguments ... )

For example, to issue the GetItem call for Item ##4503432058 and return all
information, you do:

  eBay.GetItem(:DetailLevel => 'ReturnAll', :ItemID => '4503432058')

or to see your last invoice using the GetAccount call, you do:

  eBay.GetAccount(:AccountHistorySelection => 'LastInvoice')

See the "eBay Web Services SOAP API Guide" for acceptable parameters and values
for each API call.  This guide can be downloaded at eBay's 
{SOAP Development Center}[http://developer.ebay.com/soap/].

==== Passing Complex Data Types

A number of elements in eBay's schema are XML Schema simple types.  For
example, CategoryID, Title, and Description are all strings.  But many 
elements, like Item and Seller, are of types "ItemType" and "SellerType", 
respectively.  These are complex data types, meaning they are structures
composed of collections of simple types.

"How do I make a complex type object?", you ask.  Simple:

  EBay.<element_name>( ... hash of named-arguments ... )

creates a new <em><element_name></em> element of type <em><element_name></em>Type.  For
example,

  EBay.Item(:Title => 'Mouse Pad', :Description => '...')

creates a new ItemType object.  Please note, these factory methods are class
methods of module EBay, so the upper-case "E" in "EBay" is not a typo.  A
more common way to see this is:

  EBay::Item( ... )

The only difference is if you do not pass any arguments to the factory method
and do not explicitly put empty parentheses (), Ruby will assume it is a 
constant, not a method.

==== Setting XML Attributes

The symbol you use to set an XML attribute on an element is:

  :xmlattr_<attribute_name>

For example, to create a <Label> element (corresponding to eBay's LabelType)
with an attribute of "visible" equal to "true", you would do:

  EBay.Label(:Name => "some string", :xmlattr_visible => true)


=== Format of Responses

There is a one-to-one correspondence between the XML returned by eBay and the
way you access the values contained therein using the response object returned
by the call.  For example, let's say you issued a "GetItem" call:
  
  resp = eBay.GetItem(:DetailLevel => 'ReturnAll', :ItemID => '4503432058')

and eBay returned the following XML (abbreviated where appropriate):

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" 
                    xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" 
                    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
   <soapenv:Body>
    <GetItemResponse xmlns="urn:ebay:apis:eBLBaseComponents">
     <Timestamp>2005-12-09T09:40:41.602Z</Timestamp>
     <Ack>Success</Ack>
     <Version>437</Version>
     <Build>e437_core_Bundled_2119808_R1</Build>
     <Item>
      ...

      <AutoPay>false</AutoPay>
      <BuyerProtection>ItemIneligible</BuyerProtection>
      <BuyItNowPrice currencyID="USD">0.0</BuyItNowPrice>
      <Country>US</Country>
      <Currency>USD</Currency>
      <Description>Fund. of Physics, 5th, by Halliday, Resnick, Walker</Description>
      <Escrow>None</Escrow>
      <GiftIcon>0</GiftIcon>
      ...

      <ShipToLocations>US</ShipToLocations>
      <ShipToLocations>CA</ShipToLocations>
     </Item>
    </GetItemResponse>
   </soapenv:Body>
  </soapenv:Envelope>


The "resp" object is of type
  
  SOAP::Mapping::Object

and contains all the XML elements between <tt><GetItemResponse> ... </GetItemResponse></tt>.

So, if you want to print the item description, just do:

  puts resp.item.description

and you will see:
  
  "Fund. of Physics, 5th, by Halliday, Resnick, Walker"

Repeated XML elements automatically become arrays of the same name, so to see
all the locations this item can ship to, just do:

  resp.item.shipToLocations.each { |loc| puts loc }

and you will see:

  US
  CA

It's that easy! (Are any Java or C# developers reading this?  Don't be
jealous... ;)

=== A Note about Case

Astute readers (all of you, right?) will notice that the first letter of every
element contained within the response object is lower-case, even though in the
XML it is upper-case.  This is currently the way things are and you will have
to remember to lower the first character in your code.  

Ruby's convention is that only classes, modules, and constants begin with 
upper-case letters.  The author of the SOAP4R library (which contains 
wsdl2ruby.rb) respected this convention, and as a result, the eBay.rb 
file I use (generated from eBay's WSDL) has this mapping.

I haven't come up with any Ruby magic to dynamically allow upper-case first
characters to work also, so if you happen to want to take a crack at it and
get it working, please send me your patches (see "Author" section at the 
bottom).

Please note, the opposite does _not_ apply.  That is, you can *submit* a call
using either case of the first character, and your arguments can also have
either case letter first.  For example, this:

  resp = eBay.GetItem(:DetailLevel => 'ReturnAll', :ItemID => '4503432058')

is the same as:

  resp = eBay.getItem(:detailLevel => 'ReturnAll', :itemID => '4503432058')


== Debugging

If "eBay" is your eBay caller object, as in:

  eBay = EBay::API.new( ... )

You can see XML wiredumps by doing:

  eBay.debug = true

before you issue any eBay API calls.  This is useful to see the raw XML of
what eBay is sending back to you.
