== Welcome to eBay4R

eBay4R is a Ruby wrapper for eBay's Web Services SOAP API (v433). Emphasis is
on ease of use and small footprint.

<b>This code is currently alpha stage</b>. Please email bug reports to
gdolley [at] ucla.edu

Current releases and CVS snapshots can be downloaded from:

http://rubyforge.org/projects/ebay4r


== Requirements

* SOAP4R library newer than v1.5.5.  At the time of this writing, the latest
  version was v1.5.5, which will not work.  You have to get a snapshot that is
  dated 11-06-2005 or newer.  You can find development snapshots here:

  http://dev.ctor.org/download

  So, for example, to download the 11-06-2005 snapshot (the one I personally
  used during development), go here:

  http://dev.ctor.org/download/archive/soap4r-20051106.tar.gz


== Optionals

* RubyGems, to run the stock examples without changing the 'require' lines
  (see Getting Started)


== Getting Started

If you installed eBay4R from a tarball or CVS, you will want to add the
ebay4r/lib directory to your Ruby include path.  Then put

  require 'eBayAPI.rb'

at the top of your programs.

If you installed eBay4R with RubyGems, you don't have to add anything to
Ruby's include path, just put

  require 'rubygems'
  require_gem 'ebay'

at the top of your programs.

=== Examples

Look at the examples/ directory.  Edit the file myCredentials.rb and insert
the appropriate values.  Then you can run any of the example programs.

Please note the examples all use RubyGems.  If you don't have RubyGems 
installed, change the 'require' lines on top as indicated above.


==== Hello, World!

The simplest eBay API call is "GeteBayOfficialTime".  Here's how to call it
with eBay4R:

  require 'rubygems'
  require_gem 'ebay'

  #
  # Example of GeteBayOfficialTime call
  #

  # Put your credentials in this file
  load('myCredentials.rb')

  # Create new eBay caller object.  Omit last argument to use live platform.
  eBay = EBay::API.new($authToken, $devId, $appId, $certId, :sandbox => true)

  # Call "GetEbayOfficialTime"
  resp = eBay.GeteBayOfficialTime

  # Report results
  puts "Hello, World!"
  puts "The eBay time is now: #{resp.timestamp}"

  # Wasn't that easy?!


== Debugging

If "eBay" is your eBay caller object, as in:

  eBay = EBay::API.new( ... )

You can see XML wiredumps by doing:

  eBay.debug = true

before you issue any eBay API calls.  This is useful to see the raw XML of
what eBay is sending back to you.
