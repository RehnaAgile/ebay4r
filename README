== Welcome to eBay4R

eBay4R is a Ruby wrapper for eBay's Web Services SOAP API. Emphasis is on ease
of use and small footprint.



== Requirements

* SOAP4R library newer than v1.5.5.  At the time of this writing, the latest
  version was v1.5.5, which will not work.  You have to get a snapshot that is
  dated 11-06-2005 or newer.  You can find development snapshots here:

  http://dev.ctor.org/download

  So, for example, to download the 11-06-2005 snapshot (the one I personally
  used during development), go here:

  http://dev.ctor.org/download/archive/soap4r-20051106.tar.gz


== Getting started


== Tips

* If "eBay" is your eBay caller object, as in:

  eBay = EBay::API.new( ... )

  You can see XML wiredumps by doing:

  eBay.debug = true

  before you issue an eBay API call.  This is useful to see the raw XML of
  what eBay is sending back to you.
